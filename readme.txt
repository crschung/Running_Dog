[DONE] At least one hierarchical object of at least two-levels in the hierarchy  (e.g. human arm body -> shoulder -> elbow -> wrist...).
The dog is a multi-level hierarchical 3D object as the legs, facial features and tail are one object

[DONE] Make use of at least two textures either procedural or mapped. You must map them to a(n) object(s) in a meaningful way. Using the textures from the Lab modified assignment base code does not count toward the two. Simply placing a texture on a default object using the default object coords does not count. Using textures as in the lab code with no meaningful or non-trivial development does not count.
Not sure if done correctly, but mutiple textures (dog, tree, eyes, ground) were using mapping. 

[DONE/ATTEMPTED] Convert the ADS shader in the assignment base code from a vertex shader to a fragment shader. You need to compute the lighting equation per fragment.
Converted from ADS Vertex to Fragment in main.html but unsure if done correctly

[DONE/ATTEMPTED] Convert the Phong to Blinn-Phong in the new fragment shader created in step 3.
Converted to Blinn-Phong in main.html at Line 64 and 70 but unsure if done correctly as I did not notice anything different

[NOT DONE] At least one shader edited or designed from scratch to perform a clearly visible effect. Each line of your shader code must be commented clearly explaining exactly what the following line does and why. You must clearly identify the purpose and effect the shader produces in the submitted README.
No time.

[DONE] 360 degree camera fly around using lookAt() and setMV() to move the camera in a circle while focusing on a point that the camera is circling. This can be a single fly around or can be a part of a composed scene or can be a loop.
Eye flies around the scene

[NOT DONE] Connection to real-time. You should make sure that your scene runs in real-time on fast enough machines. Real-time means that one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.
Nothing I modified justified real-time

[DONE] You should display the frame rate of your program in the console window or the graphics window once every 2 seconds.
Prints FPS every 2000ms
